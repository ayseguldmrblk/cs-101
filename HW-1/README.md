# C#101 Course Project: Odev1

This is a small project I created as part of Patika Dev's C#101 course. The project consists of several parts that involve user input and processing.

## Part 1: Positive Numbers and Even Numbers

In this part, the program prompts the user to enter a positive number and then asks the user to input that many numbers. It then identifies and displays the even numbers from the entered list.

## Part 2: Divisibility Check

This part involves taking two numbers 'n' and 'm' as input. 'n' represents the count of numbers the user will input, and 'm' is the divisor. The program then prompts the user to input 'n' numbers and checks whether each number is divisible by 'm'.

## Part 3: Reversed Strings

For this part, the program takes a number as input and then prompts the user to input that many strings. After collecting the strings, it displays them in reverse order.

## Part 4: Sentence Analysis

In this part, the program takes a sentence as input and analyzes it. It calculates the number of words in the sentence and the total number of characters.

## Usage

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Follow the instructions for each part and provide the required inputs.
