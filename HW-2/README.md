# C#101 Course Project: Odev2

This project contains three C# programs, each solving a different problem.

## Q1: Prime Number Checker
### File 'Q1.cs' 

This program checks if a given list of numbers is prime or non-prime. It prompts the user to input 20 numbers and then classifies each number as prime or non-prime. It then displays the prime numbers and non-prime numbers separately.

## Q2: Smallest and Biggest Numbers

### File: Q2.cs

This program prompts the user to input 20 numbers and then finds and displays the smallest 3 numbers and their average, as well as the biggest 3 numbers and their average.

## Q3: Vowel Sorter

### File: Q3.cs

This program takes a user-input sentence and extracts the vowels (a, e, i, o, u) from it. It then sorts the vowels and displays them.

## How to Run:
1. Open your terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Q3.cs file using the cd command:
```sh
    cd path/to/directory
```
3. Run the program using the dotnet run command, replace "*X*" with the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3) in the following command::
```sh
    dotnet run QX.cs
```
